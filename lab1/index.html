            <p>Remy, a young rat with heightened senses of taste and smell, dreams of becoming a chef like his human
              idol,
              the
              late
              Auguste Gusteau, but the rest of his colony, including his older brother Émile and his father, the clan
              leader
              Django,
              only eat for sustenance and are wary of humans. The rats live in an elderly woman's attic outside Paris,
              but
              when the
              woman discovers them, they are forced to evacuate, and Remy is separated from the others. Encouraged by an
              imaginary
              Gusteau, he explores until he finds himself on the roof of Gusteau's eponymous restaurant.</p>
            <p>Remy notices the restaurant's new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, attempting to fix a soup he ruined, and
              jumps
              in to fix
              Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy in the act, but does not reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau's
              former
              sous-chef
              and the new owner and chef of the restaurant. Skinner confronts Linguini over the soup, but when the soup
              is
              accidentally served and proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the restaurant's only female chef,
              convinces
              Skinner to
              retain Linguini and uphold Gusteau's motto, "Anyone can cook". After demanding that Linguini replicate the
              soup,
              Skinner
              spots Remy and orders Linguini to take him outside and kill him. Once they are alone, Linguini discovers
              that
              Remy can
              understand him, and he convinces Remy to help him cook.</p>
            <p>Remy controls Linguini's movements like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hiding under his toque.
              They
              recreate
              the soup, and continue cooking at the restaurant. Colette begrudgingly trains Linguini, but steadily comes
              to
              appreciate
              him heeding her advice. Later, Remy finds Émile and reunites with the clan. After Remy tells Django that
              he
              intends to
              stay at the restaurant, Django shows him a group of exterminated rats in an attempt to convince him that
              humans
              are
              dangerous, but Remy ignores his warnings and leaves.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Skinner discovers a letter from Linguini's late mother stating that Linguini is Gusteau's
              illegitimate son,
              and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Skinner is shocked and enraged about this revelation, as
              Gusteau's
              will stated
              that he would inherit ownership of the restaurant only if no biological heir appeared two years after the
              latter's
              death. After his lawyer verifies that Linguini is Gusteau's heir, Skinner hides the evidence in an
              envelope,
              but
              Remy
              finds it, escapes, and shows it to Linguini, who then sacks Skinner and discontinues a line of frozen food
              that
              Skinner
              had started. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular, and Linguini's life improves as he
              develops a
              romantic relationship with Colette. Food critic Anton Ego, whose previous negative review of the
              restaurant
              indirectly
              led to Gusteau's death, announces to Linguini that he will review the restaurant again the following day.
              After
              Linguini
              takes credit for Remy's cooking at a press conference, he and Remy have a falling out. As revenge, Remy
              leads
              his clan
              to raid the restaurant's pantries. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, he
              furiously
              expels
              Remy and his clan from the restaurant.</p>
            <p>The next day, Remy is captured by Skinner but quickly freed by Django and Émile. After returning to the
              restaurant, he
              and Linguini reconcile, and Linguini reveals Remy to his staff, who all immediately quit. Reminded of
              Gusteau's
              motto,
              Colette returns to help the clan cook under Remy's direction, while Linguini waits tables. Skinner and a
              health
              inspector attempt to interfere, but are locked in the pantry by the rats. Remy creates a variation of
              ratatouille which
              reminds Ego of his mother's cooking. Ego asks to meet the chef, and is stunned upon being introduced to
              Remy
              after the
              restaurant closes for the day. The next day, he writes a review titled "France's Finest", stating that he
              has
              come to
              understand Gusteau's motto, and describing Remy–without revealing that he is a rat–as "nothing less than
              the
              finest chef
              in France".</p>
            <p>After Skinner and the health inspector are released, they inform the authorities and Gusteau's is shut
              down,
              stripping
              Ego of his job and credibility. Remy, Linguini and Colette open a bistro, called La Ratatouille, which a
              now-happier Ego
              invests in and frequents; the rat colony settles into the bistro's attic as their new home.</p>
